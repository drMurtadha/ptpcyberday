# PTP Cyber Day Tech Talk 3 – AI × Cybersecurity Panel Project

## 1. Context
You are a panelist for PTP Cyber Day Tech Talk 3, a podcast-style discussion about **AI** and **Cybersecurity**. The audience will include **managers**, **technical teams**, and **everyday workers** at **Pelabuhan Tanjung Pelepas (PTP)**. Other panelists are from **MMC**, **UTM**, and **Enfrasys**. The goal is to provide **clear**, **practical answers** backed by trusted sources like the **World Economic Forum (WEF)**. We want to link **global trends** with **real-life challenges** and **opportunities** at the port so that everyone—from **crane operators** to **senior management**—can understand how **AI** and **cybersecurity** are shaping their **roles**, **responsibilities**, and future career paths.

We aim to make these concepts practical by using real-world examples, explaining technical terms in plain language, and showing direct connections to daily work. This makes the session not only informative but also directly applicable, helping the audience see where they can improve operations, boost security, and work smarter with technology.

## 2. Panel Questions

### AI Section
1. For **critical operations** like **crane control** or **automated maintenance**, is it safe to let **AI** assist or take full control? Where should we set the **limit** to keep things safe, and how can we ensure there’s always a reliable backup plan?
2. Instead of **replacing workers**, how can **AI** create **new jobs** at the port—such as **AI supervisors**, **data analysts**, or **robotics coordinators**—and what training will these roles need?
3. If **AI** makes a **mistake**, who should be **responsible**, and how can we set up clear rules for **accountability** and problem resolution?

### Cybersecurity Section
4. With **AI** now able to **copy voices** and create **realistic videos**, how can we tell what’s **real** and what’s **fake**, especially in urgent situations where time is limited?
5. How can **PTP** protect itself from **AI-powered cyberattacks** or **scams**, and what **technology**, **training**, and **processes** should be in place for strong protection?
6. How can **non-IT staff** stay safe from **AI scams** and **phishing attempts**, and what daily habits can reduce risks?
7. Can **AI protection tools** help **everyday people**, or are they mainly for **large companies**?

### General Section
8. What are the **dos** and **don’ts** for using **AI** at work so we avoid **risk** and keep **company data secure**?
9. Could **overusing AI** cause employees to lose **critical thinking** and **problem-solving skills**, and how can we prevent this decline?
10. How can we make **humans** and **AI** work **together** effectively so that human strengths are enhanced instead of replaced?

## 3. WEF-Based Answers

### AI Section
**1. AI in critical port operations**  
**WEF** recommends a **“human-in-the-loop”** approach for **safety-critical work**, meaning a **trained human** should always be ready to take over if needed. Just like **pilots** use **autopilot** but remain alert, **AI** can assist in **crane operations**, **container stacking**, or **predictive maintenance**, but **final control** must remain with **skilled operators**. For example, the **Port of Los Angeles** uses **AI** to monitor threats instantly, yet **human teams** make the emergency calls, ensuring a balance between **speed**, **accuracy**, and **judgment**.

**2. AI creating new jobs**  
**WEF’s 2024 report** highlights that **AI** often **creates more jobs** than it replaces. At **PTP**, new opportunities could include **AI system supervisors**, **robotics managers**, and **predictive maintenance specialists**. These positions shift workers from repetitive work to tasks involving **problem-solving**, **decision-making**, and **strategic planning**.
- **Predictive Maintenance Specialist**: Without AI – workers manually inspect equipment, often detecting issues too late. With AI – sensors send early alerts, allowing maintenance before breakdowns occur.
- **Robotics Manager**: Without AI – operators coordinate machines manually, tracking schedules and safety rules themselves. With AI – managers oversee optimised robot operations, focusing on improving efficiency and safety.
- **AI System Supervisor**: Without AI – analysts sift through logs, video, and reports manually. With AI – supervisors get instant summaries and alerts, enabling faster responses and better coordination.
Upskilling programs can train staff to interpret AI outputs, identify risks, and make data-driven decisions.

**3. Accountability for AI mistakes**  
Under **WEF’s guidelines**, the **organisation** using **AI** is fully **accountable** for its performance. This includes keeping **detailed logs** of AI decisions, having **override procedures**, and conducting **root-cause investigations** when errors happen. In 2023, a European railway operator saw service delays after AI scheduling errors caused by faulty data. Because they kept clear records and had override rules, they fixed schedules and restored operations within hours—demonstrating why accountability builds trust.

### Cybersecurity Section
**4. Spotting AI fakes**  
**Deepfakes** are now realistic enough to trick experienced staff. To make them easier to spot, remember the acronym **V.A.C.T.** — **Verify**, **Ask**, **Check**, **Think**. **Verify** requests through **secure channels** like official phone lines, internal messaging, or in-person checks. **Ask** specific security questions only the real person would know, which can expose fakes. **Check** for inconsistencies in tone, background, or timing that don’t match the person’s usual behaviour. **Think** before acting — always **pause and confirm** before following any urgent orders, especially those involving money, data, or access rights.

**5. Stopping AI cyberattacks**  
Attacks at the **Port of Nagoya** and **DP World** show that ports are prime targets. Key defences include **AI-powered threat detection**, **industry-wide intelligence sharing**, and **regular security drills**. The **Port of Los Angeles Cyber Resilience Center** is an example of how collaboration can reduce risks.

**6. Protecting non-IT staff**  
Human error causes most breaches. Remember the acronym **S.A.F.E.** to stay protected: **S**et strong, unique passwords; **A**dd two-factor authentication; **F**amiliarise yourself with realistic training that shows examples of AI scams; **E**valuate every suspicious request before acting. These simple habits make it much harder for attackers to succeed.

**7. Everyday AI protection**  
Affordable tools now **block phishing emails**, **alert users** about compromised credentials, and **block malicious sites** in real time, often sending instant notifications so users can act immediately. Many of these tools also offer **browser extensions** that flag suspicious links, **password managers** that monitor for data breaches, and **AI-powered email filters** that learn to spot new scam patterns. These protections are no longer just for large corporations—**SMEs and individuals** can also access them at low cost, sometimes even for free, making advanced security measures available to anyone with an internet connection. By using them daily, even small teams and solo users can greatly reduce their exposure to cyber threats.

### General Section
**8. AI dos and don’ts**  
**Do:** 1) Follow **clear AI policies** that define approved uses, 2) **Double-check AI outputs** for accuracy, 3) Ensure tools comply with **security/privacy standards**.  
**Don't:** 1) Upload **confidential or sensitive data** into public AI tools, 2) Rely on AI without human review, 3) Ignore company rules or bypass security checks when using AI.

**9. Avoiding skill loss**  
Over-reliance on AI can erode problem-solving skills and make employees less confident in their own judgment over time. Staff should regularly tackle challenges without AI to keep their reasoning sharp, compare AI outputs with trusted sources to identify any gaps or errors, and work in teams to analyse problems from multiple angles for broader perspectives. They can also rotate through tasks that require manual analysis, hold group problem-solving sessions without technology, and review past AI mistakes as case studies to strengthen their critical thinking abilities. By combining AI use with intentional skill-building exercises, organisations can maintain a workforce that is both tech-savvy and independently capable.

**10. Working with AI**  
**Future jobs** will rely on **creativity**, **empathy**, **leadership**, and **strategic thinking**—all human traits AI can’t truly replicate because they require emotional intelligence, ethical judgment, and cultural awareness. While AI can process data, recognise patterns, and handle repetitive work with high efficiency, humans will continue to lead in **innovation**, **relationship building**, and **big-picture planning** that demand adaptability and imagination. Leveraging AI for routine tasks not only frees people to focus on activities that deliver the most value, but also gives them more time to mentor others, build strong networks, and design strategies for long-term growth. This balance between human insight and AI efficiency ensures that technology becomes a partner in progress, rather than a replacement for the unique strengths people bring to the workplace.
